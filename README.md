# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhishek — Module Lead UI Engineer

I specialize in building **intuitive, performant, and secure user interfaces** that turn complex workflows into seamless digital experiences. With deep expertise in **React.js, Redux, and modern frontend ecosystems**, I blend design precision with engineering rigor to craft scalable, user-centric web applications.

I don’t just build UIs — I contribute to **High-Level (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD)** decisions, shaping frontend architecture for long-term performance, maintainability, and code quality.  
I collaborate closely with product, design, and backend teams to ensure every feature is **elegant, responsive, accessible, and aligned with business goals**.
